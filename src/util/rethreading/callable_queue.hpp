/*
 * Queue that stores and executes functions.
 * An event loop using epoll or other Linux APIs can listen the readability of `fd`.
 * When `fd` becomes readable, the event loop can call `execute` which will execute all
 * stored functions.
 *
 * This is useful for executing some tasks on another thread that has an event loop listening
 * to file descriptors.
 * It is mainly used to execute tasks on the main thread which has a `wl_event_loop`.
